# OpenSKOS Image Annotation Demo

This is a demonstration application that provides:

* search for high-resolution images in [Europeana](http://europeana.eu/) through the [Europeana
  API](http://pro.europeana.eu/api)
* free-text annotation of images powered by [Annotorious](http://annotorious.github.io) and tagging with controlled
  vocabulary terms from [OpenSKOS](http://openskos.org)


## Known Issues

* Tag autocompletion only recognizes the following special characters: `.` `,` `-` `(` `)`
* Alphabetic characters outside the English alphabet are not handled
